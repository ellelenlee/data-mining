# Data-Mining Projects

## Project A: Clustering

### 1. Partitioning Clustering

* Pre-processing data
* Find the ideal number of clusters
* K-means with the best two clusters
* Find the mean of each attribute for the winner cluster
* Check consistency of the results 
* Investigate alternative input configurations


### 2. Hierarchical Clustering
* Perform hierarchical clustering (for single, complete, etc)
* Create a dendrogram
* Check the cophenetic correlation and discuss the findings
* Coorplot function and discuss the findings

## Project B: Forecasting 

### 3. MLP & SVR
* Discuss the input selection problem and propose various input configurations
*	Design a number of MLPs, using various structures (layers/nodes) / input parameters and show in a table their performances comparison based on provided stat. indices	
* Design an SVR and use various structures/parameters (incl. linear/nonlinear kernels)
*	Provide the best results both graphically (prediction output vs. desired output) and via performance indices
